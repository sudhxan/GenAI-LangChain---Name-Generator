# GenAI-LangChain---Name-Generator

## Introduction
1. In the provided repository, a personal project has been developed to innovate in the culinary domain through AI-assisted creativity. Utilizing the LangChain Framework's Sequential Chain model, this project uniquely generates restaurant names and then uses those names to inspire a sequence of menu items. This dual-output capability of the Sequential Chain model demonstrates a novel application of AI in generating cohesive and contextually related content.

2. The project seamlessly integrates the LangChain framework with OpenAI's API, leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's language models. To facilitate secure and personalized access, the implementation includes a structure for a 'secret_key.py' file, where users can input their own OpenAI API key. This approach ensures both the customization of the user experience and the security of their API credentials.

3. An accompanying image showcases the final output as displayed in a web browser. This visual representation is essential for understanding the user interface and the project's practical application. The snapshot offers a glimpse into how the AI-generated content is presented to the end-user, highlighting the project's usability and design aesthetics.

4. The Generative AI model is hosted on Streamlit, a popular platform for deploying web applications. This choice of hosting solution underscores the project's commitment to accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Streamlit's free hosting service enables wide accessibility, allowing users to interact with the AI model without financial barriers.
