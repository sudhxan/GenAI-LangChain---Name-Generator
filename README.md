# GenAI-LangChain---Name-Generator

1.In this repository, I have made a personal project to generate the names of a restaurant and sequentially input the name of the restaurant to another prompt template to generate the menu items as well.

2. The LangChain framework has been implemented with OpenAI's api key.
